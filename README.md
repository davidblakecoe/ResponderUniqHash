Sometimes responder will capture the same hash over and over and not skip it properly.  I may have been running an older version with a bug, but instead of trying to manually clean up thousands of duplicate hashes I created this.

All hashes need to be in the same file, then just run it through the tool.  This has not been tested on all hash types.
